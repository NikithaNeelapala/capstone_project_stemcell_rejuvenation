    <p class="n">
        Preserving the umbilical cord, specifically the cord blood, is typically done through a process called cord blood banking. Cord blood contains valuable stem cells that can be used for medical treatments or research in the future. There are two main options for cord blood preservation:
         </p>
         <p>
            a.Public Cord Blood Banking:
          .This is a charitable option where you can choose to donate your baby's cord blood to a public cord blood bank. These banks collect, process, and store cord blood donations for use by anyone in need of a stem cell transplant.
         </p>
         <p>
           b.Private Cord Blood Banking:
          .Private cord blood banks offer the option to store your baby's cord blood exclusively for your family's use. This means the stem cells will be available for potential future medical treatments for family members.
          .To preserve cord blood privately, you should choose a reputable cord blood banking company and register with them during your pregnancy. They will provide you with a collection kit, which you bring with you to the hospital when you go into labor.
          </p>
          <p class="j">
            HERE ARE THE GENERAL STEPS INVOLVED IN PRESERVING CORD BLOOD PRIVATELY:
          </p>
          <p>
            1.Choose a Cord Blood Bank: Research and select a private cord blood bank that meets your needs and has a good reputation. Consider factors such as cost, the quality of services, and storage options.
          </p>
          <p>
             2.Pre-registration: Contact the chosen cord blood bank to pre-register and arrange for the collection kit to be sent to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            3.Collection Kit: Receive the cord blood collection kit before your due date and keep it readily accessible.
            </p>
          <p>
            4.Notify Your Healthcare Provider: Inform your healthcare provider and the labor and delivery team at the hospital that you plan to preserve the cord blood. They will need to be aware of the process.
            </p>
          <p>
            5.Collection: After the baby is born and the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the healthcare provider will collect the cord blood into the provided kit. This procedure is safe and painless for both the baby and mother.
            </p>
          <p>
            6.Shipping: The collected cord blood is packaged in the collection kit and shipped to the cord blood bank, where it will be processed and stored at extremely low temperatures (cryopreserved).
